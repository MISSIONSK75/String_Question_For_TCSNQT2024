Story-Based Array Manipulation
Problem: You are given an array of integers representing the scores of participants in a game. A participant is considered to have a "good score" if their score is greater than or equal to 50. Count how many participants have a "good score."

Input:

The first line contains the number of participants, n.
The second line contains n integers representing the scores.
Output: Return the number of participants who have a good score.

Example:

Input: 
5
45 67 34 89 52

Output: 
3



##CODE:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static int countGoodScores(int[] scores) {
        int count = 0;
        // Iterate through the scores and count how many are >= 50
        for (int score : scores) {
            if (score >= 50) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of participants:");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        
        int[] scores = new int[n];
        System.out.println("Enter the scores:");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scores[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        int goodScores = countGoodScores(scores);
        System.out.println("Number of participants with good scores: " + goodScores);
    }
}
